\begin{abstract} 
 The aim of this paper is to provide a simple survey of \pilotjobs, or
 as we will see capabilities that have are claimed to be \pilotjobs.
 In the pursuit of developing interoperable, extensible and
 general-purpose \pilotjobs we realized that there was no agreed upon
 definition or conceptual framewor of \pilotjobs. That led to the
 \pstar model. The aim of this work is not to discuss the \pstar
 conceptual framework, but to catalogue existing \pilotjobs, different
 aspects of \pilotjobs and illustrate how \pilotjobs have been used.
 Interestingly we find that \pilotjobs have been used even before they
 were named as such!

\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction} 

Why have \pilotjobs have successful? At least in part, due to the
decoupling between task/workload specification and task management.

The seamless uptake of distributed infrastructures by scientific
applications has been limited by the lack of pervasive and
simple-to-use abstractions at multiple levels – at the development,
deployment and execution stages. Of all the abstractions proposed to
support effective distributed resource utilization, a survey of actual
usage suggested that \pilotjobs were arguably one of the most
widely-used distributed computing abstractions – as measured by the
number and types of applications that use them, as well as the number
of production distributed cyberinfrastructures that support them.  

\jhanote{Needs more careful discussion/elaboration} The fundamental
reason for the success of the \pilotjob abstraction is that \pilotjob
liberate applications/users from the challenging requirement of
mapping specific tasks onto explicit heterogeneous and dynamic
resource pools. \pilotjobs also thus shields application from having
to load-balance tasks across such resources.  The \pilotjob
abstraction is also a promising route to address specific requirements
of distributed scientific applications, such as coupled-execution and
application-level
scheduling~\cite{ko-efficient,DBLP:conf/hpdc/KimHMAJ10}.

A variety of PJ frameworks have emerged: Condor-G/
Glide-in~\cite{condor-g}, Swift~\cite{Wilde2011},
DIANE~\cite{Moscicki:908910}, DIRAC~\cite{1742-6596-219-6-062049},
PanDA~\cite{1742-6596-219-6-062041}, ToPoS~\cite{topos},
Nimrod/G~\cite{10.1109/HPC.2000.846563}, Falkon~\cite{1362680} and
MyCluster~\cite{1652061} to name a few. Although they are all, for the
most parts, functionally equivalent -- they support the decoupling of
workload submission from resource assignment -- it is often impossible
to use them interoperably or even just to compare them functionally or
qualitatively.  The situation is reminiscent of the proliferation of
functionally similar yet incompatible workflow systems, where in spite
of significant a posteriori effort on workflow system extensibility
and interoperability (thus providing post-facto justification of its
needs), these objectives remains difficult if not infeasible.



\subsection{Prior Work}

Our initial investigation~\cite{Luckow:2008la} into
\pilot-Abstractions was motivated by the desire to provide a single
conceptual framework --- referred to as the P* Model, that would be
used to understand and reason the plethora and myriad \pilotjob
implementations that exist.

\jhanote{The below is legacy from pilotdata paper.. to be refined}


\section{A  Quick Survey of Existing Pilot-Jobs Systems}

The aim here is to develop both an understanding of what \pilotjobs
are and a listing of the different \pilotjobs, e.g. Swift, Condor
Glide-in, DIANE, DIRAC.

\jhanote{How do we choose which ones to survey or include in our
  survey, which ones do we not include?}

A specific implementation of the P* model that both unified
conceptually as well as was interoperable across myriad grid
middleware, led to BigJob~\cite{saga_bigjob_condor_cloud} -- a
SAGA-based \pilotjob, which was used to support a range of
applications, ranging from uncoupled ensembles of molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations~\cite{saga_bigjob_condor_cloud}, to Ensemble-Kalman
filter based applications~\cite{gmac09} with global synchronization to
loosely-coupled MD simulations with pair-wise
synchronization~\cite{async_repex11}.  Although BigJob provided the
syntactical uniformity, i.e., a common API and framework for different
grids, our experience led us to understand that different \pilotjobs
had different semantics and capabilities, and made vast if not
inconsistent assumptions of applications/users. This motivated our
efforts in search of a common minimally complete model of \pilotjobs,
and resulted in the \pstar model~\cite{pstar12}. 


%thereby it is required by necessity to be general.

\jhanote{We need a structure to our survey of existing
  \pilotjobs. What might this be?}

There is an axes with a sliding scale of dependence/coupling to
infrastructure.  It is difficult to assign a single point of coupling,
betweeen \pilotjobs and the environment for like most other tools they
are often used in a variety of ways.  We will simply use ``general
purpose'' as a reference to the variety of (i) application types
(static versus dynamic, DAG versus) (ii) existence/requirement of
special purpose infrastructure (iii) functional extensibility and/or
modularity and/or coupling to environment.

\subsection{Historical Context}

\subsection{What have Pilot-Jobs been used For?}

\jhanote{This should provide a functional approach to pilot-jobs. Will
  make the job of explaining easier.}

\section{Understanding the Landscape: Developing a Vocabulary}

\jhanote{Having surveyed now let us develop the vocabulary.}

\jhanote{I think the main framework + concepts from P* can be used
  here? Any reason not to? What else can be used?}

\subsection{Different components of the Landscape}

  different \pilotjobs}

\section{Conclusion and Discussion}

\subsection{The need for a common minimum model}

%Whereas we will discuss in greater detail some of the concepts upon
%which this paper is built, for completeness we briefly outline them
%here.

Once a common and uniform conceptual model was available, the notion
of \pilotdata was conceived using the power of symmetry, i.e., the
notion of \pilotdata was as fundamental to dynamic data placement and
scheduling as \pilotjobs was to computational tasks. As a measure of
validity, the \pstar model was amenable and easily extensible to
\pilotdata.  The consistent and symmetrical treatment of data and
compute in the model led to the generalization of the model as the
{\it P* Model of Pilot Abstractions}.


\subsection{Lessons for Workflow System}

The current state of workflow (WF) systems~\cite{nsf-workflow,1196459}
provides a motivating example for the P* Model and the Pilot-API: even
though many WF systems exist (with significant duplicated effort),
they provide limited means for extensibility and interoperability.  We
are not naive enough to suggest a single reason, but assert that one
important contributing fact is the lack of the right interface
abstractions upon which to construct workflow systems; had those been
available, many/most WF engines would have likely utilized them (or
parts thereof), instead of proprietary solutions.

% That would not immediately allow WF implementations to interoperate,
% but would make semantic mapping between them significantly simpler,
% thus supporting the very notion of interoperation.

Significant effort has been invested towards WF interoperability at
different levels -- if nothing else, providing post-facto
justification of its importance. The impact of missing interface
abstractions on the WF world can be seen through the consequences of
their absence: WF interoperability remains difficult if not
infeasible. The Pilot-API in conjunction with the P* Model aims to
prevent similar situation for \pilotjobs.

%\footnote{To be fair: we are not sure if a generic model and/or a
%  generic WF API are achievable {\it on a useful level} -- we think,
%  nevertherless, that our discussion is valid.}
