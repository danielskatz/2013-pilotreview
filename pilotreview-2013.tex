\begin{abstract} 
  There is no agreed upon definition of \pilotjobs; however a
  functional attribute of \pilotjobs that is generally agreed upon is
  they are tools/services that support multi-level and/or
  application-level scheduling by providing a scheduling overlay on top of the
  system-provided schedulers. Nearly everything else is either specific
  to an implementation, open to interpretation or not agreed upon. For
  example, are \pilotjobs part of the application space, or part of
  the services provided by an infrastructure? We will see that
  close-formed answers to questions such as whether \pilotjobs are
  system-level or application-level capabilities are likely to be
  elusive. Hence, this paper does not make an attempt to provide
  close-formed answers, but aims to provide appropriate context,
  insight and analysis of a large number of \pilotjobs, and thereby
  bring about a hitherto missing consilience in the community's
  appreciation of \pilotjobs.  Specifically this paper aims to provide
  a comprehensive survey of \pilotjobs, or more generically of
  \pilotjob like capabilities. A primary motivation for this work
  stems from our experience when looking for an interoperable,
  extensible and general-purpose \pilotjobs; in the process, we
  realized that such a capability did not exist. The situation was
  however even more unsatisfactory: in fact there was no agreed upon
  definition or conceptual framework of \pilotjobs.  To substantiate
  these points of view, we begin by sampling (as opposed to a
  comprehensive survey)~\onote{a few lines above we say that we're doing a comprehensive survey!} some existing \pilotjobs and the different
  aspects of these \pilotjobs, such as the applications scenarios that
  they have been used and how they have been used. The limited but
  sufficient sampling highlights the variation, and also provides both
  a motivation and the basis for developing an implementation agnostic
  terminology and vocabulary to understand \pilotjobs; Section \S3
  attempts to survey the landscape/eco-system of \pilotjobs.  With an
  agreed common framework/vocabulary to discuss and describe
  \pilotjobs, we proceed to analyze the most commonly utilized
  \pilotjobs and in the process provide a comprehensive survey of
  \pilotjobs, insight into their implementations, the infrastructure
  that they work on, the applications and application execution modes
  they support, and a frank assessment of their strengths and
  limitations.  An inconvenient but important question -- both
  technically and from a sustainability perspective that must be
  asked: why are there so many similar seeming, but partial and
  slightly differing implementations of \pilotjobs, yet with very
  limited interoperability amongst them?  Examining the reasons for
  this state-of-affairs provides a simple yet illustrative case-study
  to understand the state of the art and science of tools, services
  and middleware development.  Beyond the motivation to understand the
  current landscape of \pilotjobs from both a technical and a
  historical perspective, we believe a survey of \pilotjobs is a
  useful and timely undertaking as it provides interesting insight
  into understanding issues of software sustainability.

\section{Introduction} 

\jhanote{this paragraph states the importance of \pilotjobs for
  distributed infrastructure}
  
The seamless uptake of distributed infrastructures by scientific
applications has been limited by the lack of pervasive and
simple-to-use abstractions at multiple levels – at the development,
deployment and execution stages. Of all the abstractions proposed to
support effective distributed resource utilization, a survey of actual
usage suggested that \pilotjobs were arguably one of the most
widely-used distributed computing abstractions – as measured by the
number and types of applications that use them, as well as the number
of production distributed cyberinfrastructures that support them.
\jhanote{Interestingly we find that \pilotjobs have been used even
  before they were named as such!}

\jhanote{Now develop the following paragraph along the lines of: Why
  have \pilotjobs been successful?}

The fundamental reason for the success of the \pilotjob abstraction is
that \pilotjob liberate applications/users from the challenging
requirement of mapping specific tasks onto explicit heterogeneous and
dynamic resource pools.  In other words, at least in part, due to the
decoupling between task/workload specification and task management.
\pilotjobs also thus shields application from having to load-balance
tasks across such resources.  The \pilotjob abstraction is also a
promising route to address specific requirements of distributed
scientific applications, such as coupled-execution and
application-level scheduling~\cite{ko-
  efficient,DBLP:conf/hpdc/KimHMAJ10}.

  \onote{I think the most important reasons why Pilot Jobs being so
    popular (and re-invented over and over again) is that they allow
    the execution of small (i.e., singe / few-core) tasks efficiently
    on HPC infrastrucutre by massively reducing queueing time. HPC
    sites (from schedulers to policies) have always been (and still
    are) discrimatory against this type of workload in favor of the
    large, tightly-coupled ones. Pilot-Jobs try to counteract. While
    this is certainly not the main story that we want to tell, this
    should IMHO still be mentioned. } \jhanote{This is definitely one
    of the main reasons, but as Melissa pointed out it during RADICAL
    call, it is by no means the only reason. Need to get the different
    reasons down here.. then find a nice balance and description}

\jhanote{Although pilotjobs have solved/addressed many problems, now
    develop the problem with \pilotjobs themselves..}
A variety of PJ frameworks have emerged: Condor-G/
Glide-in~\cite{condor-g}, Swift~\cite{Wilde2011},
DIANE~\cite{Moscicki:908910}, DIRAC~\cite{1742-6596-219-6-062049},
PanDA~\cite{1742-6596-219-6-062041}, ToPoS~\cite{topos},
Nimrod/G~\cite{10.1109/HPC.2000.846563}, Falkon~\cite{1362680} and
MyCluster~\cite{1652061} to name a few. Although they are all, for the
most parts, functionally equivalent -- they support the decoupling of
workload submission from resource assignment -- it is often impossible
to use them interoperably or even just to compare them functionally or
qualitatively.  The situation is reminiscent of the proliferation of
functionally similar yet incompatible workflow systems, where in spite
of significant a posteriori effort on workflow system extensibility
and interoperability (thus providing post-facto justification of its
needs), these objectives remains difficult if not infeasible.

% \subsection{Prior Work}

\jhanote{The below is legacy from pilotdata paper.. to be refined}


\section{A Quick Survey of Existing Pilot-Jobs Systems}
\onote{OLE's SECTION}\jhanote{Ole, several people are already working
  in this section. You need to coordinate with existing authors here}
\onote{I'm not sure if I like how we split up between this section and
  section 'PILOT-JOB SYSTEMS REVISITED'. This will probably lead to a
  lot of redundancy and a confusing read. Wouldn't it be better to
  develop the landscape and vocabulary first and then use that to have
  a comprehensive discussion on Pilot Jobs? }\jhanote{We have had this
  discussion several times already! This is a limited sampling... in
  from the perspective of the developers etc.. before we provide a
  unifying description and then revisit a larger sample of
  \pilotjobs}

The aim here is to develop both an understanding of what \pilotjobs
are and a listing of the different \pilotjobs, e.g. Swift, Condor
Glide-in, DIANE, DIRAC.

\jhanote{How do we choose which ones to survey or include in our
  survey, which ones do we not include?}
\mtnote{Within a historical frame where the first pilot-like implementation/abstraction is presented followed by its evolutions/reinterpretation, we would review those abstractions/implementations that signed evolutionary steps. For completeness we could just mention those that did not offer a tangible progress.}
\mrnote{Recommend we be careful of the word 'survey' if we 
don't plan on being comprehensive}

A specific implementation of the P* model that both unified
conceptually as well as was interoperable across myriad grid
middleware \mrnote{needs language smoothing}, led to 
BigJob~\cite{saga_bigjob_condor_cloud} -- a
SAGA-based \pilotjob, which was used to support a range of
applications, ranging from uncoupled ensembles of molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations~\cite{saga_bigjob_condor_cloud}, to Ensemble-Kalman
filter based applications~\cite{gmac09} with global synchronization to
loosely-coupled MD simulations with pair-wise
synchronization~\cite{async_repex11}.  Although BigJob provided the
syntactical uniformity, i.e., a common API and framework for different
grids, our experience led us to understand that different \pilotjobs
had different semantics and capabilities, and made vast if not
inconsistent assumptions of applications/users. This motivated our
efforts in search of a common minimally complete model of \pilotjobs,
and resulted in the \pstar model~\cite{pstar12}. 


%thereby it is required by necessity to be general.

\jhanote{We need a structure to our survey of existing
  \pilotjobs. What might this be?}

There is an axes with a sliding scale of dependence/coupling to
infrastructure.  It is difficult to assign a single point of coupling,
between \pilotjobs and the environment for like most other tools they
are often used in a variety of ways.  We will simply use ``general
purpose'' as a reference to the variety of (i) application types
(static versus dynamic, DAG versus) (ii) existence/requirement of
special purpose infrastructure (iii) functional extensibility and/or
modularity and/or coupling to environment.

\subsection{Historical Context}
\mrnote{Melissa's Section}
\onote{My comment in the introduction probably fits here.}

\jhanote{Melissa, how does introducing terminology like
  first-generation \pilotjobs, second-generation \pilotjobs sound?}

\pilotjob-System Evolution:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pre-\pilotjob Systems: Master/Worker systems (e.\,g.\ AppLeS) that 
    support dynamic scheduling in heterogeneous, dynamic grid environments 
    mostly via directly interaction with the respective resource.
    \item First generation: Extension of pre-\pilot systems to support dynamic 
    scheduling on top of a \pilot mechanism, i.\,e.\ a placeholder job.
    \item Second generation: complex workload management systems based on \pilots.
\end{itemize}

\alnote{Another interesting point to cover is: how the invention of \pilots 
and application-level scheduling compare to the invention of traditional local 
batch queuing system (that were also invented to make resource sharing and 
utilization efficient)}
Methodologies for distributed resource management:
\begin{itemize}
    \item local resource manager (batch queueing):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item centralized: Torque
        \item decentralized (w/ fewer central components): Condor
    \end{itemize} 
    \item meta scheduling
    \item advance reservations
    \item class ads
    \item \pilots
\end{itemize}

Further points to cover:
\begin{itemize}
\item What motivated the creation of Pilot-Jobs?
\item Reference Kuba's thesis
\end{itemize}

As the uptake of grids grew, the need for job submission management
via batch queuing systems and middleware access also grew. Many
machines implemented their own batch queuing systems, and oftentimes
these systems varied from machine to machine. Many scientific
communities began running into the same problems: (i) heterogenous
resources, (ii) workload management, and (iii) support of various
applications~\cite{cern-slides}. There was a need to be able to
harness the power of these heterogeneous resources to run
jobs. User-level, rather than resource-level, control of workloads
were also necessary to facilitate the running of many jobs with
potentially long runtimes. \jhanote{Lots of terms/concepts introduced
  in previous sentence. Needs slower and careful decompression..}
Efficient load balancing and resource utilization across the existing
grid hardware \jhanote{I think grid is a model of resource federation
  and management, so if anything software and services, definitely not
  hardware} drove the desire for user-level control of tasks and ease
of use of job descriptions for data driven
applications. \jhanote{again lots of terms and concepts which need
  elaboration}

\subsection{What have Pilot-Jobs been used For?}
\mrnote{Melissa's Section}
\jhanote{This should provide a functional approach to pilot-jobs. Will
  make the job of explaining easier.}

How are and were Pilot-Jobs used?
For:
\begin{itemize}
\item High-Throughput Simulations
\item Dynamic Simulations
\item Other - Multi-scale simulations \mrnote{Dynamic load balancing for MPI jobs} 
\item Other - To Be Identified
\end{itemize}

\jhanote{Melissa - please start converting into full text for this and
  previous sub-section}

\subsection{Informal Description of Pilot-Job Systems}
\alnote{AL/MS}

\pilotjobs have existed on grid infrastructures for some time. 
Efficient load balancing and resource utilization
across the existing grid hardware drove the desire for 
user-level control of tasks and ease of use of job descriptions for
data driven applications.  \pilotjobs provide the ability to 
distribute workload across multiple systems and
provide an easy way to schedule many jobs at one time. This in turn
improves the utilization of resources, reduces the net wait time of a
collection of tasks, and also prevents saturation of resource batch
queuing systems from high-throughput simulations where many jobs
need to be run at one time.

\subsubsection*{Criteria and Classifications}

We assess the \pilotjob-Systems according to the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}
	\item What use cases? What applications types are supported? MPI, ensembles, workflows? Single vs. multi-purpose?
	\item What low-level infrastructures/middleware are supported? How interoperable is the framework?
	\item Scale of distribution
	\item Internal Architecture (communication \& coordination, central vs. decentral architectures; push vs. pull model, agent-based; number of supported pilots/resources; vertical/horizontal integration...)
	\item Deployment Model: service versus tool/library, application vs. system-level
    \item Abstraction/Programming Model: CLI, Scripting (SWIFT), API, Web service
	\item Performance and Scalability (Task Throughput)
	\item Fault Tolerance
	\item Interoperability (vertically, horizontally)
	\item Integration with higher-level tools (e.g. workflow systems, data analysis systems)
	\item Scheduling: supported algorithms, support for application-level 
	scheduling, data-compute scheduling, resource acquisition/release policies, dispatch policies, number of scheduling levels
	\item Support for Data
	\item Security (Single vs. Multi-User)
	\item Deployment Model: centrally hosted vs. application-level library
\end{itemize}

As shown Figure~\ref{fig:figures_classification}, PJ systems operate on
different levels of the distributed computing stack: (i) PJ systems that
solely provide a simple \pilot capability, (ii) systems that provide resource
management capabilities based on \pilots and (iii) applications, tools and
services that utilize \pilots. Higher-level applications and tools either 
provide a highly-integrated vertical framework, which deeply integrates the PJ 
system (e.\,g.\ Swift/Coaster), or rely on a third-party 
\pilotjob framework, e.\,g.\ Pegasus which re-uses on Condor-G for piloting.

          \pilots and (iii) applications, tools and services that
          utilize \pilots for resource management. \jhanote{we should
            change the ``higher-level pilot-based frameworks'' to
            ``higher-level frameworks that can use pilot-jobs''.}}

\subsubsection{Basic Pilot-Job Systems}
Condor-G/Glide-in~\cite{condor-g} is one of the pioneers of the \pilotjob
concept. Glide-in is a mechanism by which user can add remote grid resources
to the local condor pool and run their jobs on the added resource the same way
that all condor jobs are submitted. The resources added are available only for
the user who added the resource to the pool, thus giving complete control over
the resources for managing jobs without any queue waiting time. Glide-in
installs and executes necessary Condor daemons and configuration on the remote
resource, such that the resource reports to and joins the local Condor pool.
Glide-in is limited in that the daemons must be running on a given resource,
meaning that this process must be approved by resource owners or system
administrators.

The Coaster system~\cite{coasters} is another \pilotjob implementation
which has been shown to work in both cloud and grid
environments. Coaster has been designed to support Swift-based applications. Using the Coaster service, one executes a Coaster Master
on a head node, and the Coaster workers run on compute nodes to
execute jobs. Coasters offers a zero-install feature in which it
deploys itself and installs itself from the head node and onto the
virtual machines without needing any prior installation on the
machine. 

\pilotjobs were used at CERN on grid infrastructure to process experiments 
performed with the Large Hadron Collider~\cite{copilot-tr}. 
A desire to utilize a wider variety of computing resources, including 
enterprise and private clouds, to analyze such experiments drove the creation 
of Co-Pilot~\cite{copilot-tr}, which acts as a layer on top of existing
grid/batch systems to allow job submission to clouds and grid infrastructures. 
CoPilot uses XMPP messaging to communicate between the VMs and the grid 
infrastructure. Co-Pilot is based more on the actual
submission of jobs and is limited in its user-level controllability and 
allowance of application-level programming.

Venus-C~\cite{venusc-generic-worker} provides a \pilotjob-like
capability on Microsoft Azure clouds called a Generic Worker. The
Generic Worker creates a layer of abstraction above the inner workings
of the cloud.  The idea behind the Generic Worker is to allow
scientists to do their science without requiring knowledge of backend
HPC systems by offering e-Science as a service. Venus-C has not been
shown to work with grids, because its main objective is to motivate
scientists to use cloud infrastructures.  While the notion of moving
to the cloud for data-driven science is an important one, many
existing cyberinfrastructures still have powerful grid computers that
can also be leveraged to assist with the data-driven computations.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Pilot-based Scheduling}
AppLeS~\cite{Berman:2003:ACG:766629.766632} is a framework for 
application-level scheduling. For this purpose, AppLeS provides an agent that 
can be embedded into an application enabling the application to acquire 
resources (e.\,g.\ via Globus, SSH or Legion) and efficiently schedule tasks 
onto these. Further, AppLeS provides different application templates,
e.\,g.\ for parameter sweep, master-worker and moldable parallel applications.

\jhanote{AppLeS is not strictly \pilotjob based?  but \pilotjob like
  capabilities?} \alnote{The question is: when is a \pilot a \pilot? When the 
  use the term \pilot and when \pilot-like? Apples has a component -- the 
  Actuator (Quote from paper: "... handles task launching, polling, and 
  cancellation ..."), which 
  is quite similar to a \pilot. But maybe AppLeS is something for 
  the history section or a separate category for Master/Worker frameworks... 
  PJ evolved from the need to map master/worker style computations to 
  heterogeneous, dynamic distributed grid environments. Added a pre-\pilot 
  category to the history sub-section.}

GlideinWMS~\cite{1742-6596-119-6-062044} is a higher-level workload management
system that is based on the \pilot capabilities of Condor-G/Glide-in. The
system can based on the current and expected number of jobs in the pool,
automatically increase or decrease the number of active Glide-ins (\pilots)
available to the pool. GlideinWMS is a multi-user \pilotjob system commonly
deployed as a hosted service. In contrast to low-level \pilotjob systems,
GlideinWMS attempts to hide rather than expose the \pilot capabilities from
the user. GlideinWMS is currently deployed in production on OSG and is the
recommended mode for accessing OSG resources.
Corral~\cite{Rynge:2011:EUG:2116259.2116599} is a GlideinWMS frontend which
provides more explicit control over the placement and start of \pilots to the
end-user. Higher-level frameworks, such as Pegasus, can utilize Corral to
optimize the placements of \pilots with respect to their workload.

Another workload management systems that is based on Condor-G/Glidein is
PanDA~\cite{1742-6596-331-7-072069}. In contrast, a Condor-G only approach,
PanDA can utilize multiple queues; each \pilot is assigned to a certain PanDA
internal queue.

\subsubsection{Higher-Level Frameworks}

Many higher-level tools and frameworks, such as workflow, visualization or
data analytics systems, utilize \pilotjob systems to manage their
computational workload. In general, two approaches exist: (i) the framework
vertically integrates with a custom \pilotjob implementation or (ii) it
re-uses a general purpose PJ system. In case (i), the PJ system is often
re-factored to also serve a multi-purpose PJ system.

\subsection{Common Terms and Definitions}

\alnote{What to do with the terms, such as many-task computing, meta 
computing, grid computing, etc.? It might make sense to couple the evolution 
of \pilots to the evolution of these infrastructure paradigms (hypes). Maybe 
in history section.}

The terminology used to describe the implementations of pilot-job reviewed in
section 2 varies depending not only on the type of implementation considered --
simple/core, pilot-based scheduling and higher-level application framework --
but also on the application domain where they are deployed and leveraged.
Nonetheless, some common concepts can be identified so that a common vocabulary
can be developed. The goal is to leverage such a vocabulary to ...
\mtnote{what exactly do we want to achieve with Section 4?}.

'Late-binding' is one of the concepts that persist unchanged across all the
pilot-job implementations. 
\begin{itemize}
        \item Late-binding: 
\end{itemize}

The very same nature of pilot-job is that of enabling a late-binding of
resources to jobs. This is what allows for a pilot-job to offer 'load
balancing', 'scheduling' and to some extent 'domain distribution'. Late-binding
is also directly related to the possibility for a pilot-job system to fulfil
the qualitative requirements related to the efficiency with which jobs are
distributed, scheduled and executed by the user on one or more distributed
infrastructure. \mtnote{shall we assume these definitions? I think so but I
want to be sure.}

\alnote{Can we start of with the P* elements so that we have something?}

\section{Pilot-Job Systems Revisited}
\aznote{Ashley's section}
Despite the apparent diversity in existing Pilot-Jobs,
they can be reduced to a set of common functionality and
discussed as such.  This reduction has implications
for the interoperability of existing and future Pilot-Jobs, and
lends insight into application design to enhance job/data(?)
mobility, management, and potential run-time responsiveness via
late-binding/etc.
\subsection{Comparing Pilot-Jobs via a Common Framework \& Vocabulary}
\aznote{Ashley's section}
\jhanote{Having developed the vocabulary let us now talk about the
  different \pilotjobs}
%\mrnote{I don't like calling it understanding pilot jobs. I think by
%now in the paper one should understand}
%\aznote{Here are some suggestions from me: ``Pilot-Jobs in context'',
%``Understanding Pilot-Jobs via the P* Model'', ``Existing
%Pilot-Jobs in light of the P* model'', ``Classifying and 
%Comparing Pilot-Jobs''...  none of these are perfect I think, but I
%think I like no.2 best}
%\aznote{Revisit previous pilot-jobs using the vocabulary from the
%previous section, pointing out the commonalities and overlap.}

%\aznote{Example: Diane's RunMaster covers the role of the Pilot-Manager, and
%the Pilot-Job is handled by Diane's worker agent.  This is similar to the 
%BigJob and Swift-Coaster Pilot-Job implementations.  Condor-G may appear
%different because of X, but in actuality...}

\subsubsection{DIANE}
\aznote{Section copied and pasted from IPDPS paper for now -- plan
to use this general sort of information + reword using our spiffy 
P* vocabulary}
% Coordination and Communication
DIANE~\cite{Moscicki:908910} is a task coordination framework, which
was originally designed for implementing master/worker applications,
but also provides PJ functionality for job-style executions. DIANE
utilizes a single hierarchy of worker agents as well as a PJ manager
referred to as \texttt{RunMaster}.
%Further, there is ongoing work on a multi-master extension.
For the spawning of PJs a separate script, the so-called submitter script, is
required. For the access to the physical resources the GANGA
framework~\cite{Moscicki20092303} can be used.
%GANGA provides a
%unified interface for job submissions to various resource types, e.\,g.\ EGI
%resources or TG resources via a SAGA backend.
Once the worker agents are started they register themselves at the RunMaster.
In contrast to TROY-BigJob, a worker agent generally manages only a single
core and thus, by default is not able to run parallel applications (e.\,g.\
based on MPI). BJ utilizes the BJ-Agent that is able manage a set of local
resources (e.\,g.\ a certain number of nodes and cores) and thus, is capable
of running parallel applications. For communication between the RunMaster and
worker agents point-to-point messaging based on CORBA~\cite{OMG-CORBA303:2004}
is used. CORBA is also used for file staging, which is not fully supported by
BJ, yet.

% Binding 
DIANE is primarily designed with respect to HTC environments (such as
EGI~\cite{egi}), i.\,e.\ one PJ consists of a single worker agent with the
size of 1 core. BJ in contrast is designed for HPC systems such as TG,
where a job usually allocates multiple nodes and cores. To address this issue
a so-called multinode submitter script can be used: the scripts starts a
defined number of worker agents on a certain resource. However, WUs will be
constrained to the specific number of cores managed by a worker agent. A
flexible allocation of resource chunks as with BJ is not possible. By
default a WU is mapped to a SU; application can however implement smarter
allocation schemes, e.\,g.\ the clustering of multiple WUs into a SU.

%Scheduling
DIANE includes a simple capability matcher and FIFO-based task scheduler.
Plugins for other workloads, e.\,g.\ DAGs or for data-intensive
application, exist or are under development. The framework is extensible:
applications can implement a custom application-level scheduler.


%Other impl. related issues: FT and security
DIANE is, just like BJ, a single-user PJ, i.\,e.\ each PJ is executed with the
privileges of the respective user. Also, only WUs of this respective user can be
executed by DIANE. DIANE supports various middleware security mechanisms
(e.\,g.\ GSI, X509 authentication). For this purpose it relies on GANGA. The
implementation of GSI on TCP-level is possible, but currently not yet
implemented. Further, DIANE supports fault tolerance: basic error detection and
propagation mechanisms are in place. Further, an automatic re-execution of WUs
is possible.

%\upp
\subsubsection{Condor-G}
\aznote{Section copied and pasted from IPDPS paper for now -- plan
to use this general sort of information + reword using our spiffy 
P* vocabulary}
Condor-G pioneered the Pilot-Job concept~\cite{condor-g}. The pilot is
actually a complete Condor pool that is started using the Globus
service of a resource. This mechanism is referred to as Condor
Glide-In. Subsequently, jobs can be submitted to this Glide-In pool
using the standard Condor tools and APIs. Condor utilizes a
master/worker coordination model. The PJ manager is referred to as the
Condor Central Manager. The functionality of the Central Manager is
provided by several daemons: the condor\_master that is generally
responsible for managing all daemons on a machine, the
condor\_collector which collects resource information, the
condor\_negotiator that does the matchmaking and the condor\_schedd
that is responsible for managing the binding and scheduling
process. Condor generally does not differentiate between workload,
i.\,e.\ WU, and schedulable entity, i.\,e.\ SU. Both entities are
referred to as job. However, it supports late binding, i.\,e.\
resources a job is submitted to must generally not be available at
submission time. The scheduler matches the capabilities required by a
WU to the available resources. This process is referred to as
matchmaking. Further, a priority-based scheduler is used. For
communication between the identified elements Condor utilizes
point-to-point messaging using a binary protocol on top of TCP.

Different fault tolerance mechanisms, such as automatic retries, are
supported.  Further, Condor supports different security mechanisms:
for authentication it integrates both with local account management
systems (such as Kerberos) as well as grid authentication systems such
as GIS. Communication traffic can be encrypted.

\subsubsection{Swift}
\aznote{Section copied and pasted from IPDPS paper for now -- plan
to use this general sort of information + reword using our spiffy 
P* vocabulary}
Swift~\cite{Wilde2011} is a scripting language designed for expressing
abstract workflows and computations. The language provides, amongst many other
things, capabilities for executing external applications, as well as the
implicit management of data flows between application tasks. 
% For this
% purpose, Swift formalizes the way that applications can define
% data-dependencies. Using so called mappers, these dependencies can be
% easily extended to files or groups of files. 
The runtime environment handles the allocation of resources and the spawning of 
the compute tasks. 
% Both data- and execution management capabilities are provided
% via abstract interfaces. 
Swift supports e.\,g.\ Globus, Condor and PBS resources. 
% The pool of resources
% that is used for an application is statically defined in a configuration file.
% While this configuration file can refer to highly dynamic resources (such as OSG
% resources), there is no possibility to manage this resource pool
% programmatically. 
By default, Swift uses a 1:1 mapping for \cus and \sus. However,
Swift supports the grouping of SUs as well as PJs. For the PJ functionality, Swift uses the
Coaster~\cite{coasters} framework. Coaster relies on a master/worker
coordination model; communication is implemented using GSI-secured TCP sockets.
Swift and Coaster support various scheduling mechanisms, e.\,g.\ a FIFO and a
load-aware scheduler. Additionally, Swift can be used in conjunction with 
Falkon~\cite{1362680}, which also provides \pilot-like functionality.

% Falkon
% refers to \pilots as the so called provisioner, which are created using the
% Globus GRAM service. The provisioner spawns a set of executor processes on the
% allocated resources, which are then responsible for managing the execution of
% SUs. \cus are submitted via a so called dispatcher service. Similar to Coaster,
% Falkon utilizes a M/W coordination model, i.\,e.\ the executors periodically
% query the dispatcher for new SUs. Web services are used for communication.

\section{Conclusion and Discussion}

\jhanote{Main message is: (i) \pilotjobs have potential, but it is not
  being realized due to ad hoc nature of theory and practise, (ii) we
  provide first comprehensive historical and technical analysis, (iii)
  set the stage for a common conceptual model and implementation
  framework, and (iv) provide insight and lessons for other tools and
  higher-level frameworks, such as Workflow systems possibly}


\subsection{The need for a common minimum model}

%Whereas we will discuss in greater detail some of the concepts upon
%which this paper is built, for completeness we briefly outline them
%here.

Our initial investigation~\cite{Luckow:2008la} into
\pilot-Abstractions was motivated by the desire to provide a single
conceptual framework --- referred to as the P* Model, that would be
used to understand and reason the plethora and myriad \pilotjob
implementations that exist.

 
Once a common and uniform conceptual model was available, the notion
of \pilotdata was conceived using the power of symmetry, i.e., the
notion of \pilotdata was as fundamental to dynamic data placement and
scheduling as \pilotjobs was to computational tasks. As a measure of
validity, the \pstar model was amenable and easily extensible to
\pilotdata.  The consistent and symmetrical treatment of data and
compute in the model led to the generalization of the model as the
{\it P* Model of Pilot Abstractions}.


\subsection{Lessons for Workflow System}

The current state of workflow (WF) systems~\cite{nsf-workflow,1196459}
provides a motivating example for the P* Model and the Pilot-API: even
though many WF systems exist (with significant duplicated effort),
they provide limited means for extensibility and interoperability.  We
are not naive enough to suggest a single reason, but assert that one
important contributing fact is the lack of the right interface
abstractions upon which to construct workflow systems; had those been
available, many/most WF engines would have likely utilized them (or
parts thereof), instead of proprietary solutions.

% That would not immediately allow WF implementations to interoperate,
% but would make semantic mapping between them significantly simpler,
% thus supporting the very notion of interoperation.

Significant effort has been invested towards WF interoperability at
different levels -- if nothing else, providing post-facto
justification of its importance. The impact of missing interface
abstractions on the WF world can be seen through the consequences of
their absence: WF interoperability remains difficult if not
infeasible. The Pilot-API in conjunction with the P* Model aims to
prevent similar situation for \pilotjobs.

%\footnote{To be fair: we are not sure if a generic model and/or a
%  generic WF API are achievable {\it on a useful level} -- we think,
%  nevertherless, that our discussion is valid.}



%\mrnote{We have a survey of related \pilotjobs systems, a 'history'
%of \pilotjobs, and a related work section? Not sure if we should
%condense in some way. PS Why is this after conclusion?}
